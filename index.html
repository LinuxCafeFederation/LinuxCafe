			<p><h3>You may wonder why a privacy centric group who helps others learn more about alternatives to proprietary software and services is based on Discord. That is a good question, Linux Cafe was created originally to provide an alternative place to talk about Linux on Discord. As we grew so did our goals, one of those major goals was to spread the word of FOSS to those who did not know about it. Discord has provided us a large userbase of people who are into Linux and FOSS, while also giving us a well known platform able to reach those who don't know about [matrix], Telegram, Signal, Lemmy, etc. to join because they trust Discord. That is why we selfhost our own [matrix] homeserver and Telegram bridge bot and bridge all these chats together, so our FOSS focused friends can still chat and interact with our main public platform. Discord is far from perfect, but it is where Linux Cafe started, and it is still a place we care about and share as part of the Linux Cafe group.</h3></p>

					<h2>How to join our cause!</h2>
					<p>Our main code hosting service is <a href="https://gitlab.com/LinuxCafeFederation">GitLab</a> and we mirror all of our work to <a href="https://github.com/LinuxCafeFederation">GitHub</a> and <a href="https://codeberg.org/LinuxCafeFederation">Codeberg</a>. We do check issues and merge requests on GitHub and Codeberg, however we do see them and get to work on them faster if they are submitted to the proper repos on our GitLab account. </p>

<p>Without our amazing community we would not have gotten to where we are today. Our community is what defines us, the amazing people who run our bridges to Telegram and [matrix] so we can all stay connected, the ones who contribute to our Reddit and Lemmy, without you Linux Café would not exist. From the bottom of our hearts, thank you.</p>
