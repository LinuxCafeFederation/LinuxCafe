                <h1>Linux Café</h1>
                <p>Linux Café (or LinuxCafé, Linux Cafe, LinuxCafe) is a collective of Linux and open-source software
                    users
                    that promote
                    and share information about Free and Open Source Software (FOSS). We also strive to show others
                    alternatives to
                    proprietary software and services. Our goal is to create a welcoming environment and give a
                    comfortable
                    space for
                    all Linux and tech enthusiasts to come together.</p>

                <h2>About Us</h2>
                <h3>You may wonder why a privacy centric group who helps others learn more
                    about alternatives to proprietary software and services is based on Discord.
                    That is a good question, Linux Café was created originally to provide an alternative place to talk
                    about
                    Linux on
                    Discord.
                    As we grew so did our goals, one of those major goals was to spread the word of FOSS to those who
                    did
                    not know about
                    it.
                    Discord has provided us a large userbase of people who are into Linux and FOSS, while also giving us
                    a
                    well known
                    platform able to reach those who don't know about [matrix], Telegram, Signal, Lemmy, etc. to join
                    because they trust
                    Discord.
                    That is why we selfhost our own [matrix] homeserver and Telegram bridge bot and bridge all these
                    chats
                    together, so
                    our FOSS focused friends can still chat and interact with our main public platform. Discord is far
                    from
                    perfect, but
                    it is where Linux Café started,
                    and it is still a place we care about and share as part of the Linux Café group.

                <p>Our main code hosting service is <a href="https://gitlab.com/LinuxCafeFederation">GitLab</a> and we
                    mirror all of our
                    work to <a href="https://github.com/LinuxCafeFederation">GitHub</a> and

                    requests
                    on GitHub
                    and Codeberg, however we do see them and get to work on them faster if they are submitted to the
                    proper
                    repos on our
                    GitLab account.
